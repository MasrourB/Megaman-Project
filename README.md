A re-creation of the original Megaman Series with Java's Swing GUI widget toolkit.

This is a personal project of mine that I started during my winter break in between semesters.

Originally this was going to be a Super Mario project but I decided to go with Megaman to change things up a bit. After all, the intro stage background from Megaman X1 is my personal favorite first stage in any game.

The goal of this project is to make a few new levels for Megaman to traverse through. Level 1 is almost done (but it will look very different than what it is now) and more levels are on their way.

(Updates will be sporadic because I am currently busy with classes. A lot of this code needs to be cleaned up and I will get to fixing it up soon.)
